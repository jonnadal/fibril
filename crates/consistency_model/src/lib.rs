//! This library provides code to define and verify the correctness of
//! an object or system based on how it responds to a collection of potentially
//! concurrent (i.e. partially ordered) operations.
//!
//! # Defining Correctness Via A Reference Implementation
//!
//! [`SequentialSpec`] is a trait for defining correctness via a "reference implementation"
//! (e.g.  "*this system should behave like a queue*").  This library includes reusable
//! implementations such as [`Register`] for register-like semantics and for the standard
//! library's [`Vec`] for stack-like semantics.  Implementing the trait yourself is also
//! straightforward -- just define two `enum`s for invocations and returns. Then associate
//! these (as [`SequentialSpec::Op`] and [`SequentialSpec::Ret`] respectively) with a state
//! type that implements [`SequentialSpec::invoke`].
//!
//! # Verifying Concurrent System Implementations
//!
//! A concurrent system can be verified against an implementation of the [`SequentialSpec`] trait
//! by using a [`ConsistencyTester`] for an expected [consistency model],  such as
//! [`LinearizabilityTester`]. In that case, operations are sequential (think blocking I/O) with
//! respect to an abstract thread-like caller, which is identified by a distinct "thread ID"
//! (sometimes called a "process ID" in the literature, but these are assumed to be
//! single-threaded, so thread ID arguably provides better intuition for most developers).
//!
//! # Additional Reading
//!
//! For more background on specifying the semantics of concurrent systems, see
//! publications such as:
